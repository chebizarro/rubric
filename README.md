## The Rubric Framework

Rubric is a framework for writing cross-platform, modular applications using modern programming techniques and paradigms.

Version 1.0 of Rubric has the following features:

* Inversion of Control/Dependancy Injection container
* Presentation Model (PM)
* Automatic loading of resources including UI definitions and menus
* Loose coupling of modules

Rubric is inspired by the [Prism framework](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism)
